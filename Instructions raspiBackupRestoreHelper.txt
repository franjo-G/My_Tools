sudo raspiBackupRestoreHelper.sh --mountfs "fstab"

In case of an automatic backup via crontab, you have to add the option
--cron at the end, so that there is no dialogue and the defaults from the 
from the raspiBackup.conf are used. 
Example:
* * * * /raspiBackupRestoreHelper.sh --mountfs "fstab" --cron

# Other options for a dialogue-guided backup / restore.... are:
-- last (the last backup is restored Only the target data carrier is queried)
-- select (a backup to be restored can be selected from a list of available backups)
-- backup (start directly in the backup dialogue)
--delete (a backup to be deleted can be selected from a list of available backups)
  !! The delete function is only available with this Option.
  
  Together with dynamic mount, all Options --last or --select or --backup or --delete must be at the End at 3rd Position
  
  Example:
  --mountfs "fstab" --select
